More Webassets
**************

An opinionated Webassets integration for Morepath.

`Webassets <https://webassets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ |
`Morepath <http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

This package is somewhat similar to
`more.static <https://github.com/morepath/more.static>`_, which integrates
`bowerstatic <https://bowerstatic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ into Morepath.
It is currently not really used anywhere, so you should probably stick to
`more.static <https://github.com/morepath/more.static>`_.

Now that you are sufficently discouraged from using more.webassets, these are
the reasons it might be for you:

* You don't have to learn about javascript package managers (i.e. Bower).
* You can have your assets compiled on the fly.
* Your stylesheets are rendered at the top, your scripts at the bottom. No
  configuration necessary.

If you are alreay familiar with webassets: This package might not be as
powerful as you're used to. It currently has little flexibility. It's also
the first time the author uses webassets, so things might be off.

If you're using Webassets differently than me and you want your ways to work
with more.webassets, do open an issue. I'm happy to turn this into something
more powerful.

Usage
-----

The following app serves a minified jquery from `assets/js/jquery.js`
(relative to the code):

.. code-block:: python

    from more.webassets import WebassetsApp

    class App(WebassetsApp):
        pass

    @App.webasset_path()
    def get_asset_path():
        return 'assets/js'

    @App.webasset_output()
    def get_output_path():
        return 'assets/bundles'

    @App.webasset_filter('js')
    def get_js_filter():
        return 'rjsmin'

    @App.webasset('jquery')
    def get_jquery_asset():
        yield 'jquery.js'

    @App.path('')
    class Root(object):
        pass

    @App.html(model=Root)
    def index(self, request):
        request.include('jquery')

        return '<html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>'

This will result in the following html (formatted for readability):

.. code-block:: html

    <html>
        <head></head>
        <body>
            hello
            <script type="text/javascript" src="./assets/jquery.bundle.js?1234"></script>
        </body>
    </html>

For it to work you need an 'assets/js' folder with a 'jquery.js' file in the
same folder as your python file where 'MyApp' is defined.
